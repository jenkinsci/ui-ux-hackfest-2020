# Join us!

We invite all contributors to join the [Online UI/UX Hackfest](https://www.jenkins.io/events/online-hackfest/2020-uiux/) on May 25-29!
This hackfest is NOT a hackathon.
We do not expect participants to dedicate all their time during the event timeframe, but hop-in/hop-out as their time allows.
Everybody can spend as much time as they are willing to dedicate.
Jenkins development experience is not required, we have newcomer-friendly stories for those who want to start contributing to the project.
We will also have a 24/7 jenkinsci/hackfest Gitter chat for Q&A and coordination between contributors.

See the [main page](./README.md) for more information and links

## Reporting contributions

We will be using GitHub Issues in this repository to collect contributions and to generate reports from the event.

**Quality vs. Quantity:** Please do not target creating a maximum number of records, we will take contribution sizes into account during ranking.
If you are working on a single area (e.g. "testing the Windows installation guide" or "improving a Neo2 theme") during a day,
please record it as a single contribution even if it involves multiple pull requests or issues.

To report a contribution:

* [Submit a new issue](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ui-ux-hackfest-2020/issues/new/choose) to this repository to report the achievements.
  There are issue templates which will help to provide the information.
  * Please put a summary of your contribution and links
  * Screenshots are also welcome!
* **Recommended:** Share your contribution experience in social media!
  * Please use the `#JenkinsIsTheWay` hashtag so that we could discover and repost it
  
Once you submit an issue, one of the hackfest organizers will process it, add your contribution to the list and then close the issue.
Thanks in advance for your contributions!
