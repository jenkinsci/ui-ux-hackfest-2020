# Demo: Custom Jenkins Distribution build service prototype

Presented by [Sladyn Nunes](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/sladyn98/).

Sladyn will present a prototype of the Custom Jenkins Distribution build service.
This service is being developed as a Google Summer of Code 2020 project.

The main idea behind the project is to create service that could be used to build tailor-made Jenkins distributions.
The service would provide users with a simple user interface where they can define a Jenkins bundle they want to build: plugins, configurations, etc. 
Furthermore it would include a solution for sharing created distributions so that users can easily find and download already built jenkins war/configuration files to use out of the box.
