# Migrating documentation to jenkins.io

Presented by [Mark Waite](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/markewaite/).

Mark will review the goals of the Jenkins Wiki migration project. He’ll demonstrate the steps to collect, transform, and publish content from the Jenkins Wiki site to the Jenkins documentation site (jenkins.io). We’ll discuss the categories of information on the Wiki and share how we’ve prioritized the effort to include that information in the Jenkins documentation. We’ll migrate a page from the wiki, identify likely problems, and discuss how contributors can resolve those problems.
