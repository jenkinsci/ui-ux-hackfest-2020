# Hands-on: Migrating plugins to documentation-as-code

Presented by [Oleg Nenashev](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/).

Oleg will show how to migrate a plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub. We will take a plugin and perform a full migration of the docs: initial export, copy editing of the pages, moving changelogs to GitHub releases, creating a pull request to the plugin and finally doing a plugin release.
